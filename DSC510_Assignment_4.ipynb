    "This week we will implement “if statements” in a program.  Your program will calculate the cost of  fiber optic cable installation by multiplying the number of feet needed by $.87.  We will also evaluate a bulk discount.  You will prompt the user for the number of fiber optic cable they need installed.  Using the default value of $.87 calculate the total expense.  If the user purchases more than 100 feet they are charged $.80 per foot.  If the user purchases more than 250 feet they will be charged $.70 per foot.  If they purchase more than 500 feet they will be charged $.50 per foot.\n",
